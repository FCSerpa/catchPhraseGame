This is a site for a catchphrase style game to test your knowledge of types of dinosaurs.  The user can read a description of a kind of dinosaur and then reveal that animal's name.  Users can also delete dinosaurs from the database and add their own.

The site is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and Underscore.  The back end work is done with Express, Node.js, Nodemon, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

In the future, I'd like to add a way to for the computer to test the user's inputs and grade them on their accuracy.
